"""Debate Engine — multi-round dissent resolution between agents.

When consensus has dissent (agents disagree), the debate engine:
1. Identifies dissenting agents
2. Asks them to present counter-arguments
3. Allows other agents to respond
4. Re-votes after each round
5. Continues until unanimity, max rounds, or stalemate
